    """
    Entry point of the program for finding Atod Clusters.

    This code reads input from the user, processes it, and prints the resulting clusters.

    Usage:
        $ python main.py

    Input:
        - Two integers separated by a space: N and M
        - M lines each containing two integers representing connections: Ai and Bi

    Output:
        - The total number of Atod Clusters, K
        - K lines listing the number of connections each Atod Cluster has, in non-descending order
